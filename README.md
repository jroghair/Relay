# Relay
## University of Iowa Hackathon, 2018

Have you ever noticed the steep learning curve required to get involved with programming? Despite the efforts of some of the nation's best educators, our society is missing out on the talents of many of the nation's youth due to the perceived challenge of getting involved in robotics.  While some competitions exist, such as FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition, many students don't have access to the resources required to start a team.

# Enter: Relay.

We believe that getting youth involved with STEAM fields is of the utmost importance for the collective success of our planet.  Robotics is a fun and engaging way to get involved.  With Relay, teenagers have a simple way to interact with a myriad of components that are commonly used everywhere from agriculture to defense.

Let us explain how it works.

Relay is a collection of components that fit together to make a working system.  Whether your goal is to implement complex image analytics from a remote webcam through Google Cloud API or control an Arduino-based robot with a LiDAR, Relay is for you.  Configuration is performed through an easy to understand graphical user interface (a GUI for short).  Once the user configures *what* they want the system to do, they simply have to run Relay.

***Significance of the name***

The name Relay has multiple meanings.  The verb "relay" means "to receive and pass on".  Interpretted literally, our system is a way for all components of a system to share information with one another.  A relay is also an electrical device; a switch that is electronically controlled.  Based on the user's input to a relay, the system behaves differently.  See the similarity?
